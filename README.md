## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

-a video game a text based rpg (kinda like dnd)
-a story driven rpg game using rpg maker if possible.
-a cube based design game a little bit like mario, a platformer for android.
-a arena shooter game a mix of galaga and asteroid

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan on doing this alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

how extensive does this project have to be? 
if the programs end up not working does that null you grade?
i am wondering if programs like rpg maker for example are usable? since they need coding
of some kind to have actions and such work. they have a lot of assetts like characters, areas
but coding is involved to make the game work.
